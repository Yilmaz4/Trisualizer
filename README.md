**Trisualizer** is an advanced two-variable function grapher that allows users to visualize and interact with mathematical functions in real-time. It features capabilities for displaying the partial derivatives, gradient vector, normal vector, and tangent plane at any selected point on the surface, and computing double integrals over general regions using numerical methods.

Users can define custom variables, values of which can be easily adjusted with sliders, allowing for dynamic exploration of the function's properties. OpenGL compute shaders are used for high-performance computations, ensuring smooth and responsive interaction. The grapher also features realistic shading using the Blinn-Phong lighting model, enhancing the depth and realism of the rendered surface. Grid lines can also be displayed to aid in spatial orientation.
